                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Traditional property management often involved time-consuming, manual processes. Today, 
                  smart technology streamlines these operations, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency. 
                  Automated building management systems (BMS) enable property managers to control heating, 
                  ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and other essential functions remotely.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Smart scheduling for maintenance and inspections also ensures timely upkeep, preventing

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled real-time data collection, providing 
                  property managers with valuable insights. Sensors embedded in buildings monitor occupancy 
                  rates, energy consumption, and structural integrity.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  This data helps managers make informed decisions about space utilization, cost optimization, 
                  and predictive maintenance. By analyzing trends, managers can identify patterns and take 
                  proactive measures to enhance asset performance.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Smart security systems have transformed how property owners safeguard their investments. 
                  Traditional locks and keys are being replaced by biometric access control, facial recognition, 
                  and mobile-based authentication.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  As sustainability becomes a priority, smart technology plays a crucial role in energy-efficient 
                  property management. Smart thermostats, automated lighting, and solar energy monitoring systems

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Green buildings equipped with IoT sensors adjust energy use based on occupancy, ensuring that 
                  no power is wasted. This not only benefits the environment but also lowers operational costs
